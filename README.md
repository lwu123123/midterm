# Midterm mini-project

**Due Friday, May 15**

### Overview

The goal of the midterm is to produce a short report on a computational topic of your choosing. What counts as a computational topic? Here are a few examples:

- A computational method or algorithm (e.g., Monte Carlo integration, stochastic gradient descent, breadth-first search)  
- A research topic in physics that uses computational physics (e.g., computing scattering cross sections, simulating fluid dynamics)  
- A method or approach for data analysis (e.g., principle component analysis, logistic regression)  
- A type of data visualization (e.g., box plots, kernel density estimation, density plots)  
- A summary of a paper or review that discusses the use of computational methods for scientific research (topics outside of physics are also okay!)  

If there's something that you're interested in but you're not sure if it's an appropriate topic, please do ask for feedback in the Slack.

### Submitting the midterm

To submit the midterm assignment, fill in the Jupyter notebook here and upload it to your GitHub repository as usual. Even though this assignment is mostly text, we'll use a Jupyter notebook so that you can format equations and write some code if you would like.
